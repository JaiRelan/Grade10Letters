## To A Dear Man Of Science

Hey man,
From class 4, I started this thing where at the end of each year, I would write a letter to everyone who made my year enjoyable and post it to them (partially cause I didn’t have anyone else to send messages via snail mail to)…


Since your parents decided to put a double A at the beginning of your name, you’re the 4th person who’s letter I’m writing. Clearly I’ve underestimated this task, and I’m under the impression that I can write a letter for each of my close people in one day.


Being the person I am, I have absolutely no idea about the people I have in my batch, therefore, I searched around for a bit, and found an email addressed to the whole batch and am using that to help me figure out who all I actually even want to write a letter to.


The whole idea behind these is that I’m going to be sending out letters to all the people who made class 10 special for me and even though I absolutely hate this batch (I’m not sure if I’m joking at this point in time) I still find this batch as an annoying family I wish I didn’t have.


As Rosa Diaz of B99 once said, “you speak of this to anyone, and I’ll split your throat”.


However, the point of this letter is to thank you for all the fun times we’ve had together in class 10 *virtually*… From annoying you with absolutely random gossip to discussing random mistakes we made in Mr Khullar’s class, it’s been a ride (**Damn it Jai, this is the first letter and you’re already on clichés…**)


You’re a great friend to have even though you love being silent. The walks back home from school will not be the same without you listing to us and occasionally giving your inputs. It’s been nice to have a fellow cuber (I don’t know of any other) and it’s been a blast with you in 10th. 


Honestly, I probably should stop right now, cause I have a ton of more letters to write, so ignore all the other spelling mistakes and thank you for making class 10 special for me…


Love,

Water Melon
