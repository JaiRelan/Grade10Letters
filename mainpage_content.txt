Hi,
This is the parent directory of the website I made to deliver end-of-the-year letters to my classmates.

Since you're coming to this URL, I can assume that I sent you here but unfortunately, you’re in the wrong place. 

To go to your letter, there are two possible methods:
1. Go to your email address, and check for an email from **jairelan.2005@gmail.com**. You would find an email with something like “*Grade 10 Is Over!*” in the subject. In this email, there would be a link taking you directly to the letter addressed to you. 
2. The more complicated one, where the fact that I can’t spell your name will get exposed is the follow. Go to the url bar, put a slash after *jairelan.github.io/Grade10Letters* and type in your name. Since I probably cannot spell your name (even after knowing you for this long), it might take some playing around to do (disclaimer: if you call me to nag about me spelling your name wrong, I **will** cry)

In the email I’ve sent you, there also must be a password. Now, I’ve tried to choose a word which means something to the both of us, but if the password is *password* don’t blame me…
